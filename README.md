# Eternal Domination Solver

## Summary:
The 𝑚-eternal dominating set problem is an optimization problem in graphs that aims to determine the minimum number of guards capable of defending a graph against an infinite sequence of attacks. This problem has been an active research topic in the recent years and reported to have interesting applications in various domains, such as military activities, network security, and robot patrolling. Despite the extensive research on this problem, as far as we know, there is a lack of easily accessible implementations for researchers to conduct experiments, and there are also few experimental studies involving algorithms developed for the problem. In this work, the aim is to implement and provide a solver for the 𝑚-eternal dominating set problem. Also, experiments will be conducted to assess the efficaciousness of the implemented solver, both for the problem in the general case and restricted to selected graph classes.
